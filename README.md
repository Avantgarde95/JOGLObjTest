# JOGLObjTest

### What is this?
Simple OpenGL app I wrote for testing [JOGL](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/).
You can load a Wavefront .obj file and render it.
Use the following keys to control:
- w, s, a, d, q, e: translate
- j, k, l, i, u, o: rotate
- +, -: scale

### Dependencies
- [JOGL](https://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) (Version I used: 2.3)
- [Gluegen](http://jogamp.org/gluegen/www/) (included in JOGL distribution)

### Remarks
Since this app is just for testing, I did not implement all features
of .obj file. It is recommended to use simple .obj files (without material, etc.).
